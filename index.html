        <h2>How do I decide what to put in a paragraph?</h2>
        <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. 
            <br>What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. 
            The whole process is an organic oneâ€”a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</p>

    <div class="organize">
        <h2>How do I organize a paragraph?</h2>
        <p>There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. 
        The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. 
        Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:
        Narration: Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (See an example.)
        Description: Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an example.)
